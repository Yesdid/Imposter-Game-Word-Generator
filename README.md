Imposter Game
This is a web-based party game inspired by "Impostor"-style game videos I've seen on TikTok.

🎮 How to Play
1. Enter the number of players and imposters(or randomize).
2. Click **Generate** to start the game.
3. Each player views the screen one at a time to see their role:
   - **Non-imposters** see the secret word.
   - **Imposters** only see that they are an imposter — they must blend in.
4. After all players have viewed their roles, the discussion begins!
5. Players take turns giving clues related to the word.
6. Try to figure out who the imposters are before they figure out the word!

⚙️ Features
- Random word selection from a customizable word list.
- Random imposter assignment.
- "Next Player" system to privately reveal roles.
- Restart and randomization buttons.

🚀 Languages
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

# This is my first personal project :D! In the future I would like to add features where players can choose to get asked questions and discuss based on their answers while imposters get a different set of questions!
